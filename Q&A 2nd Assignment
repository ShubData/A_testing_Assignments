Q : why we use for loop when we have while and do.while loops?
A : we use for loop when we know how many times we have to run the loop.
Q : Write a real time scenario when we use do while loop?
A : We use do while loops where we want to run the code atleast once ,regardless of the condition. we can use this in a Menu option ,where menu is atleast shown once, 
    before accessing forward.
