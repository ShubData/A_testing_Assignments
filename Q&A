    True quality of service (QoS), also called "flow labeling",Built-in authentication and privacy support, Flexible options and extensions,

Q : Difference between 32bits and 64 bits Operating System?
A : A 32-bit system can access 232 different memory addresses, i.e 4 GB of RAM or physical memory ideally, it can access more than 4 GB of RAM also. 
    A 64-bit system can access 264 different memory addresses, i.e actually 18-Quintillion bytes of RAM. In short, any amount of memory greater than 4 GB 
    can be easily handled by it.
