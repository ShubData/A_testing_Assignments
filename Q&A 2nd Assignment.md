Q : why we use for loop when we have while and do.while loops?
A : we use for loop when we know how many times we have to run the loop.

Q : Write a real time scenario when we use do while loop?
A : We use do while loops where we want to run the code atleast once ,regardless of the condition. we can use this in a Menu option ,where menu is atleast shown once, 
    before accessing forward. 

Q : Write 3 real-life examples where we use infinite while loop?
A : Infinite loops generally are used in scenarios where a program has to been run continuously this can be
     a) Embedded systems: A cartridge-based video game is an embedded system that uses an infinite loop.
        The game runs an infinite loop until the console is powered off because there is no underlying OS to return to.
     b) Operating systems: OSes are infinite loops that continually check for user input and respond accordingly.
        The loop continues until the device is turned off or reset.
     c) Web servers: Web servers are designed to take a request, return a webpage and then wait indefinitely for the next request.
